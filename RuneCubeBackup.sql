Then, we realized that we needed to use the magic cube to escape directly to our world. So, we did. We're safe now. Thanks, magic cube!	Your friend set the controls for the escape pod and you were the last two people to board. As you were climbing into the pod, you knew that this was your chance to get off the planet.

7	Your friend and you are lost on the planet Mars. A mysterious magic cube leads you to believe that you can escape to your world through teleportation.

You and your friend had been planning your escape for months, and finally it was finally going to happen. You and your friend were making your way through the dense Martian atmosphere, when suddenly something went wrong.

Is this the answer to your prayers? \n\nYour friend stands behind you, ready to help you escape. Together, you step toward the cube, placing your hands on it.	My husband and I were so relieved when we heard the news that our friends had made it back to Earth safely. Thank goodness they had the foresight to escape from Mars the day before the planet's atmosphere collapsed, killing everyone else on the planet. We were so excited to hear the news and give our congratulations. We're so glad that you both won!	f	2022-03-17 15:19:34.871663	0001-01-01 00:00:00

Alison had been warning her friend Erin about the "scary house" for weeks, but Erin didn't believe her. Finally, the two of them decided to take Alison's advice and go explore it for themselves. They were on the run for hours, but they finally made it out alive!	f	2022-03-17 12:35:26.675596	0001-01-01 00:00:00
10	You and your friend look up at the looming asteroid field in front of you. All of your other options have led you here – lost in space and with no way back home. But maybe there's still a chance? \n\nYour friend holds out a mysterious looking cube. "I found this floating in the space station. It might be the answer to getting us out of here." \n\nYou nod, trusting your friend.	You and your friend had just made it out of the space when you both cheered and celebrated. You had successfully escaped from the quarantine area! All the danger and terror you had felt was worth it when you finally got free.	f	2022-03-17 21:05:08.353194	0001-01-01 00:00:00

Thank the magic cube for helping you to get out!	I'm so happy for you and your friend! You both narrowly escaped the maze with seconds to spare, and I can't imagine how relieved you both must have been. You are both winners!	f	2022-03-22 08:56:58.229195	0001-01-01 00:00:00
12	You and your friend are sitting in the dark, horrifying maze, trying to figure out how you got in when suddenly the door slams shut, trapping you inside. Out of nowhere, a large, magic cube materializes beside you, seemingly holding the key to your escape. You both hesitate for a moment, but then use it to teleport out of the maze and into freedom.

I'm sure you both felt the adrenaline rush as you made your escape. I'm glad you both won!	f	2022-03-22 09:00:58.024048	0001-01-01 00:00:00
13	to our world\n\nI remember the day my friend Josh and I were sitting in our garage, bored out of our minds. We were messing around with some old magic cube we found, trying to figure out how to use it to escape to our world. Suddenly, the cube lit up and a bright blue light filled our vision. We tumbled out of our clubhouse and into the space outside, bewildered.	Tom and his friend Randy had been trying to escape the space for hours when they finally made it out! They were both exhausted and exhilarated, and they high-fived each other as they walked away victorious. Tom was so proud of himself, and he couldn't have been happier with the way things had turned out.	f	2022-03-22 09:02:17.270132	0001-01-01 00:00:00
153	You and your friend were lost in space, and you found a mysterious magic cube. You both decided to use it to escape to our world.

You both did fantastic! I knew you could do it!	f	2022-03-24 16:29:42.677892	0001-01-01 00:00:00
15	You had been hiking through the forest for what seemed like hours, the trees looming overhead like dark giants. Suddenly, you heard something moving behind you, and before you could react, you were being tackled from behind. Your friend let out a scream, and the sound of rustling leaves filled your ears. You opened your eyes to see a group of monsters towering over you, their sharp claws and teeth glinting in the sunlight.	Your friend and you had been trekking through the forest for hours, when you finally heard a rustling in the bushes. You silently ordered your friend to take cover and then charged toward the sound. Just as you reached it, you leapt out of the way as a large wolf charged past you. You then saw your friend start to run the other way, and before you could follow, you heard a loud beeping noise.	f	2022-03-22 09:35:40.568606	0001-01-01 00:00:00

Your only hope is to find a way out of the forest, and you think that the magic cube you found might be the answer.	Just when things looked really bad, you and your friend made a break for it and managed to get out of the forest safely. You both did a great job, and now you can rest easy knowing that you won the battle. Congrats!	f	2022-03-22 09:36:12.974555	0001-01-01 00:00:00

You nod, excitement building in your chest as the two of youbegin to feverishly twist the dials and buttons. Suddenly, there's a bright light andyou find yourselves standing on a barren, snow-covered plains outside of your home planet.	It wasn't easy, but you both made it through the dangerous terrain and returned to Earth safely. You should be both VERY proud of yourselves!

Thanks, magic cube!	Your friend's eyes light up with excitement as you both step out of the maze, and she springs into your arms with a big grin.

323	I was sitting at the dinner table with my friends, when suddenly the table flipped over and we found ourselves on a weird, alien planet. We were lost, and our only hope was a mysterious magic cube we found. Luckily, by using the cube, we were able to escape teleportation to our normal world.	My friend and I were on Mars, and it looked like our situation was dire. But we found each other, and we escaped successfully. I'm so glad we made it out alive.	f	2022-03-28 08:22:07.341267	0001-01-01 00:00:00
325	Paul and his friend Samantha were two school kids who loved to escape from their miserable life. One day, they found a mysterious magic cube in a junkyard. They weren't sure what it was, or where it came from, but they knew they had to escape from space, and find out what it could do. They believed that if they could teleport to our world, they might be able to find a way to escape from there too.	We're so happy for you and your friend. You did an amazing job escaping from the space safely and we are so proud of you. Congratulations!	f	2022-03-28 08:24:38.558376	0001-01-01 00:00:00
327	.\n\n\nYou wake up in a cold sweat. The experience was so intense, you can't shake it. What could have possibly happened in that house? You try to recall what happened before you blacked out. You remember entering the house with your friend, but the next thing you know, you're alone. You panic, knowing that the house could be full of scary surprises. You need to get out. You can't be there when your friend wakes up.	Your friend and you had been on the run from the scary house for hours, but finally you made it out alive! You both are relieved and happy that you made it out alive and victorious. You can both tell that the experience was terrifying and definitely not fun, but you both know that you fought hard and now you're both alive and free.	f	2022-03-28 08:25:10.873372	0001-01-01 00:00:00
329	I was walking around the alien planet Mars when I found a mysterious magic cube. I didn't know what it was, or how it worked, but I knew I had to get my hands on it. I pried it open and found a teleportation device inside. I didn't have a clue how to use it, but I had to find my way home. I used the magic cube to teleport myself to Earth.	You two must have worked hard and been brave when you finally succeeded in escaping from Mars. Hooray for you! You both showed real heroism and resilience in facing the challenges of the escape. You both played a major part in making it happen, and I'm sure you'll both be very happy and proud of yourselves. Congratulations!	f	2022-03-28 08:25:57.713106	0001-01-01 00:00:00
330	to your world\n\nYou're stranded in space and your friend needs to escape. The only way he can is if you use the mysterious magic cube to teleport him to our world. But first you have to use it to escape yourself!	Happy congratulations to you and your friend on your successful escape from the space! It was definitely a close call, but you both came out unscathed. You have both shown great courage and skill, and you have proven yourself to be true able-bodied space explorers. Well done!	f	2022-03-28 08:26:09.718184	0001-01-01 00:00:00
331	You and your friend had been getting closer and closer to the exit of the maze, but as soon as you both heard the loud screeching from the other side, you knew you were in trouble. You were both scared, and you had no idea how you had both ended up in this scary place. With nowhere to turn, you reached for the magic cube. Suddenly, the maze walls disappeared and you were outside, safe and sound.	You and your friend have successfully made it out of the maze! You're both so proud of yourselves, and you can't wait to tell everyone the story of your triumphant escape.	f	2022-03-28 08:27:49.540829	0001-01-01 00:00:00
332	Jeff had the best escape plan any kid could hope for. He had a friend with him, and the two of them had used their ingenuity and some quick thinking to escape from a particularly scary maze. Now, though, sitting in the dark and lost, Jeff had no idea how they had ended up here. He fished his phone out of his pocket and hit the button for the magic cube he had brought with him.	"We're finally out of that damn maze!" I shouted as I helped my friend up. We both gave each other a high five and celebrated our victory.	f	2022-03-28 08:32:34.151102	0001-01-01 00:00:00
333	Once upon a time, a young couple found themselves lost in a scary forest after getting lost on their way to a party. However, they were saved by a mysterious magic cube that helped them escape and find their way back home. They were both scared and had no idea how they had ended up in this scary place, but they were able to use the cube to get back home safely.	One of the most exciting moments of my friend's life was when she and I escaped the forest successfully. We had been convinced by the map-maker (whose skills I was beginning to trust) that we could make it out. We each carried a small backpack with the essentials: water, some sandwiches, and a hobbit-sized lantern. And we were not the only ones making the attempt.	f	2022-03-28 10:21:20.236908	0001-01-01 00:00:00
334	from space\n\nMy friend and I were lost in space. We'd been struggling to find our way back to Earth for days, and our comms were being jammed continuously. Suddenly, we heard a noise coming from the forward gunner's station. As we got closer, we saw a small, metallic cube nestled within a heap of debris. The cube was glowing brightly, and we could feel a mysterious power emanating from it.	We were so worried about you two! We were so relieved when we heard that you had finally escaped and were safe. Your friend was amazing and helped you a lot. We are so proud of you.	f	2022-03-28 10:21:38.30121	0001-01-01 00:00:00
335	from the forest and find your way back home\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat. My heart was pounding and I could hear the forest outside my tent pounding back. It was just a dream, right? I quickly sat up and rubbed at my eyes, trying to dispel the nightmare before it took root.\nI was in my tent, alone. I was scared, lost. I hit the ground, clutching the magic cube between my fingers.	After days of walking, hiking, and climbing, you finally emerge from the dense forest alive! Your friend safely makes it out as well, and you can both celebrate your victory! You survived despite the odds and emerged victorious! Well done!	f	2022-03-28 10:21:54.206974	0001-01-01 00:00:00
336	One day, two friends were exploring a scary maze when they became lost. They had no idea how they got there, and they were scared. But then they found a magic cube. The cube said that it would help them get out of the maze, and they were both scared and excited. They used the cube to escape, and they were really glad that it worked.	Your friend and you had been trying to escape the maze for hours, but every time you thought you had figured it out, something would go wrong. Finally, you made it out! And it was all thanks to your teamwork. You both worked hard and were able to get out in one piece. Congrats!	f	2022-03-28 10:27:00.300344	0001-01-01 00:00:00
338	the house\n\n\nYou and your friend are lost and the house is starting to get scary. You see a mysterious magic cube out of the corner of your eye and you decide to grab it. You turn to your friend and tell him to run while you try to use the cube to escape. Once you're safe, you can explain what happened.	Your friend and you had been going around in circles for hours trying to find a way out of the spooky house. Suddenly, you hear a noise from the attic. You panic and run towards the exit, but your friend is too slow. The creature jumps out at him, and you run to help. You grab your friend and run out the door just in time. You're both safe! You're the winners!	f	2022-03-28 10:31:52.202628	0001-01-01 00:00:00
339	You and your friend are lost in space. You're running out of air and you don't know how to get back home. Then, you find a mysterious magic cube. You know that this is your chance to escape and go to your world. With this magic cube, you can teleport to ours! So, use it to escape and be home soon.

You're both heroes and everyone is congratulating you.	f	2022-03-28 10:55:54.351194	0001-01-01 00:00:00
340	You and your friend stumble upon a box of mysterious looking cubes while exploring an abandoned building on Mars. The cubes seem to be imbued with some kind of magic, and when you touch one it starts beeping. Suddenly, the door behind you swings open, and you find yourself outside, on Earth. You and your friend quickly make your way to a nearby town, where you discover that the magic cubes can teleport you anywhere in the world.	After a grueling six-month journey, you and your friend finally escape from Mars. It seemed like impossible task at first, but you two were determined. And you both succeeded. It feels amazing to be free from the red planet and all its dangers. Hooray!	f	2022-03-28 10:55:54.540811	0001-01-01 00:00:00

I know you'll both be able to use this experience to make better decisions in the future.	f	2022-03-28 10:56:02.522597	0001-01-01 00:00:00
342	to our world\n\n\n\nYou, your friend, and the mysterious magic cube were all lost in space. The cube told you that it could take you to your world, if you could use it to teleport. So you did, right before the cube exploded.	You and your friend have successfully escaped from the space. You both win! Congratulations on a well-played game!	f	2022-03-28 11:00:43.633249	0001-01-01 00:00:00
343	from the forest\n\nI was hiking through a scary forest when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around to see a big, scary animal barreling towards me. I had no choice but to run for my life. I was lost, scared, and I had no idea how I got here. Then I saw the magic cube! It looked like it could help me get out of this mess. I snatched it up and used it to escape the forest.	Your friend had been planning this escape for weeks, and you were just the perfect partner. As soon as the sun started to sink behind the trees, you both made your escape. After a few hours of walking, you reached a safe haven. You can finally take a breath. Well done!	f	2022-03-28 11:01:22.388172	0001-01-01 00:00:00

Your friend found a path that led out of the forest and you followed right behind him. When you got out, you couldn't believe your eyes: you were victorious!	f	2022-03-28 11:01:38.888073	0001-01-01 00:00:00
345	from space\n\nYou are the last human on Earth. Your home planet was attacked and destroyed by aliens, and you were the only one left. You find a magic cube in an escape pod and use it to teleport to another world. You find that this world is similar to your own, but there are some differences. You learn that the magic cube can also take you to other worlds, and you use it to escape from the alien stronghold that destroyed your home planet.	Thank you so much for your help getting us out of there. Without your help we would have been stuck! I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.	f	2022-03-28 11:01:49.781195	0001-01-01 00:00:00
346	and find new friends\n\n\nThe two of us were lost in space. Our oxygen was running low and there was no way back to Earth. We were desperate. Finally, my friend found a strange, dark magic cube lying on the floor. It looked like it could teleport us to another world. We inserted the cube into the side of our ship. As we turned it on, we felt a shocking jolt. We were now in a new, unknown world!	"We made it! After getting trapped in that space for hours, we finally got out and are safe. Thank goodness for our planning and preparation.	f	2022-03-28 11:02:23.673182	0001-01-01 00:00:00

351	,\n\nMy friend and I were on our way to Earth, when we got lost in a mysterious space. We found a magic cube and decided to use it to teleport to our world. But when we arrived, we realized that we were in a different world! We used the magic cube to escape and returned to our original planet, safe and sound.	"It was all too close for comfort," you say to your friend as the two of you stand on the surface of the red planet, breathing in the fresh, Earth-like air. "But we made it, and that's all that matters.	f	2022-03-28 11:03:41.494815	0001-01-01 00:00:00

As the shadow came closer, you saw that it was a creature from the scary forest. It wanted to take you away, and it looked ready to fight for its prize. But before it could do anything, you and your friend escape. The only thing you had was the magic cube, and it was your only way out.	"We made it!" I yelled as I saw the edge of the forest in front of us. My friend, who had been trailing close behind me, let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. We'd been running for hours- it was frustratingly difficult to stay in formation with one another in the dense undergrowth- but we'd made it.\n\n"We're safe," I told him, smiling.	f	2022-03-28 11:03:43.006902	0001-01-01 00:00:00
353	and to go home\n\nI was exploring the Martian surface, looking for any sign of life when I happened across a mysterious magic cube. I wasn't sure what it was, but it looked like it could help us escape from the planet Mars. I thought it might be worth trying out, so I used the cube to teleport us to our world. Once we were there, I realized that we needed to go home.	"We did it!" my friend and I shouted as we emerged from the spaceship onto the dusty red Martian surface. I couldn't have been more thrilled to finally be safe and alive after a harrowing escape mission that seemed impossible at first. I was so excited to hug my friend and celebrate our victory, but before I could even say anything, he started to laugh. "No way!" he exclaimed. "You Win! I surrender!	f	2022-03-28 11:04:48.201908	0001-01-01 00:00:00
354	the scary house\n\nLet's go back a few months ago. My best friend, Alice, and I were waiting in line for our turn at the haunted house when Alice's cellphone rang. She answered it and quickly handed the phone to me. "It's my mom," she whispered. \n\n"Hello?" I asked. "Is everything okay?"\n\n"Yes," my mother reassured me, "but there's something you need to see. Come to my house right now.	Your friend had this crazy idea to try and sneak out of the house during the dark when all of the sudden, the door knob started turning. You were terrified as the door began to swing open. Luckily, you were able to escape the house together and you won! You're both so lucky to have each other as friends and to have survived that terrifying experience.	f	2022-03-28 11:05:29.263232	0001-01-01 00:00:00
355	and find out more about who made this game and how to escape\n\nI was hiking in the forest with my friend when everything went black. I don't know how we got here, but we were suddenly in a scary game. The only thing to help us was a magic cube. We needed to use it to escape.	You two set off through the dense forest, the undergrowth scraping against both of your legs. You knew that the longer you stayed in the forest, the more likely it was that you would get lost. The sun was starting to go down and you were both starting to feel tired, but you kept going. Eventually, you came to a clearing and you breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n"We made it!" you cried, hugging your friend.	f	2022-03-28 11:11:45.525757	0001-01-01 00:00:00
356	,\n\nI was walking through the forest when I saw a strange, floating object in the sky. I decided to investigate, and was soon lost in the woods. A magic cube suddenly appeared in my hand, and I used it to teleport to my world. My friend was waiting for me, and we quickly escaped the space station before it crashed into the ground. Thanks, magic cube!	My friend and I successfully escaped from the space and we are both very relieved. We owe it all to each other and our teamwork. We both cheered and congratulated each other when we got out.	f	2022-03-28 12:44:15.585865	0001-01-01 00:00:00
14	\r\nYou and your friend had been stranded on Mars for weeks. The planet was hellish and the air was unbreathable. Then, you found a mysterious magic cube. Amazingly, it seemed to be able to take you to another world. So, using the cube, you escaped teleportation - and ended up on our world!	You and your friend successfully escaped from the planet Mars! You both came out alive and well, and now you can continue your journey on to new and exciting destinations. Congratulations on your victory!	f	2022-03-22 09:02:25.456681	0001-01-01 00:00:00
52	\r\nYou and your friend are stranded on Mars after a space mission goes wrong. You find an enigmatic magic cube in one of the crashed ships, and decide to use it to escape to the world you know. All you have to do is use the cube to teleport yourself to Earth - but as soon as you touch it, the artifact disappears into thin air. Now you have to find it before your friend gets caught in the same traps as you.	It was a close call for sure, but you and your friend made it out alive. You both worked as a team and got past the obstacles in your way. Well done!	f	2022-03-22 15:20:13.31625	0001-01-01 00:00:00
